            <div class="abstract-text">The use of Multiple Access protocols information in Internet of Things environments has gained significant interest over the past decade, particularly for crowd behavior monitoring. Due to its high data rates and low infrastructure requirements, Wi-Fi is considered one of the most promising wireless technologies for leveraging the explosive growth of transmitted data from mobile devices. However, with the introduction of MAC address randomization and the application of new randomization policies on assigning randomized sequence numbers to transmitted frames in mobile devices to enhance privacy, traditional approaches to device identification face significant challenges. To tackle this issue, we conduct a comprehensive analysis at the Multiple Access level and propose CrowdWatch which is an innovative framework designed to enhance the understanding and utilization of MAC randomization dynamics. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach that leverages multiple device-specific features to accurately associate frames with randomized MAC addresses to their corresponding devices. By integrating multi-modal fingerprints, the framework can effectively identify mobile devices and track their behavior. The presented approach ensures reliable detection even under the latest randomization policies. We examined the introduced framework through real-world experiments, and the findings prove that it is an effective solution for smart building management and occupancy estimation in dynamic environments.</div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Hydrogen production via cost-effective electrochemical water splitting is one of the most promising approaches to confront the energy crisis and to obtain clean fuels with high energy density. To address this concern, herein, we developed a simple one-step synthesis method for creating an AuAgCu trimetallic alloy using aspirin as a capping agent. This alloy shows potential for efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. The trimetallic nanoparticles based alloy exhibit an equiaxed grain-like morphology and a face-centred cubic phase. In HER experiments using a 1 M KOH electrolyte, the AuAgCu alloy shows nearly negligible overpotential compared to mono- and bimetallic catalysts, and the Tafel slope was 32.7 mV dec‚Åª¬π, which is the lowest ever achieved for alloy-based electrocatalysts and extremely close to a commercially available Pt/C with high stability for 21 days and no decrease in current density in alkaline media. Besides, with excellent HER activity and stability, the trimetallic AuAgCu-modified electrode possessed significant durability for over 1000 cycles in the selected range of potential from 0.5 to 0.8 V at different scan rates from 1 to 100 mV s‚Åª¬π. This simple, cost-effective and environmentally friendly methodology can pave the way for the exploitation of mixed metal alloy-based electrocatalysts not only for water splitting but also for other applications, such as fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.</div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Despite recent advancements, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) remains a difficult task, particularly when dealing with drone videos. A variety of challenges, such as data association, varying levels of occlusion, camera motion, and missing detection, affect the effectiveness of MOT tasks. Data association in tracking-by-detection approaches plays a critical role in determining how detections from previous frames are linked to generate coherent tracks. To address this challenge, merging spatial and visual cues may not lead to identical matching pairs for the given detections and tracks. Thus, the performance of the MOT task can be improved by pairing them individually and then determining the best matching pair. It is therefore proposed a Multi-Class MOT (MCMOT) tracker with a cascaded data association strategy in which, during the first stage, matching pairs based on appearance and spatial information are identified separately. The best matching pair is then identified out of these pairs in the second stage and updated as an active track. In addition, the Kalman Filter (KF) estimation and Constant Velocity Assumption (CVA) model are employed to effectively address scenarios involving missed detections and occlusion handling by utilizing motion data. Experiments were carried out on the two state-of-the-art datasets, VisDrone-MOT and UA-DETRAC, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCMOT tracker, which demonstrated the improved performance when compared against six different state-of-the-art trackers by providing as input different detectors.</div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Drone deployment has become crucial in a variety of applications, including solutions to traffic issues in metropolitan areas and highways. On the other hand, data collected via drones suffers from several problems, including a wide range of object scales, angle variations, truncation, and occlusion. To process and manipulate visual data from the drones, a variety of image processing algorithms have been employed, each with a distinct aim. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning, have attracted broad interest and are being applied to many domains in the framework of smart cities, including road traffic monitoring. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of drone-based traffic monitoring systems from a deep learning perspective. This work focuses on vehicle detection, tracking, and counting, since they are fundamental building blocks towards founding solutions for traffic congestion, flow rate and vehicle speed estimation. Additionally, drone-based datasets are examined, which face issues and problems caused by the diversity of features inherent of drone devices. The review analysis presented in this work summarizes the literature solutions provided and deployed so far and discusses future research trends in establishing a comprehensive traffic monitoring system in support of the development of smart cities.</div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Alongside many traditional as well as novel applications, in the latest years drones have been widely adopted as remote sensing platforms for road traffic monitoring in urban areas and on highways. The problem of traffic monitoring on Region of Interest (RoI) based on drone imagery is a challenging task, especially when the surveillance drone is constantly moving. In this work, two specific sub-tasks have been addressed. The goal of the first stage is to predict the RoI in drone imagery of traffic scenes using deep learning-based approaches instead of traditional image processing; in this connection, the goal of second task is to perform vehicle detection on the selected RoI. To ensure diversity and robustness, drone images with different altitudes, positions and view points have been considered. To achieve these goals, two custom aerial datasets for RoI extraction and detection were built by collecting aerial sequences from flying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and by transmitting them to the base station leveraging 5G technology. Two different ad-hoc deep learning-based architectures have been designed for the RoI extraction task to maximize the accuracy and inference speed, respectively, and have been evaluated on two different datasets: a custom-built dataset and a Massachusetts roads dataset. Finally, the models providing the best performance have been combined to further improve the overall results. Experimental tests show that the proposed framework represents a promising solution for drone-based road traffic monitoring in critical areas, exploiting imagery from a variety of viewing angles and altitudes.</div>

            <div class="abstract-text">From smart cities development perspective, road vehicle detection exploiting drone-based aerial imagery are a crucial part of traffic surveillance and monitoring systems where effective results are of utmost demand. A recent boom in the field of Deep Learning (DL) has provided remarkable development in the problem of vehicle detection. Aerial views pose more complexity with respect to the ground view but rapid advancement in the field of DL, the volume of data and hardware configuration have facilitated the realization of these intelligent detection systems effectively. In this paper a detailed performance evaluation of some of the main state-of-the-art DL-based object detection techniques has been carried out along with an experimental analysis of vehicle detection using RetinaNet framework on the VisDronebenchmark dataset. The performance of RetinaNet framework has been validated together with the results provided by the VisDrone team. Further experiments are then conducted to investigate the impact of various parameters. Finally, the selection of suitable models that can be practically implemented is also discussed based both on a qualitative and quantitative analysis. </div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Remotely piloted vehicles have become more and more popular in recent years due to their increased availability on the market. In general, drones can represent a threat for public safety due to their potential misuse. This motivation gives rise to the need of devising specific methods and techniques to monitor sensitive areas, in order to deploy effective drone surveillance systems. These systems are designed to detect nearby undesired targets, and to neutralize impending threats. One of the main tasks involved in this scenarios is target localization, which can be performed with different approaches. In particular, in this article we carry out a study on the main literature works related to the framework of wireless target localization based on RF and WiFi techniques, providing a thorough analysis on the perspective of their deployment in drone surveillance applications. </div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Modern Telecom Sector is eventually facing exceptionally tough challenges because of continuous and unexpected increase in power density requirement for the communicating machinery and equipment. To fulfil the power requirements for the equipment, a significant architecture and an optimal technique must be introduced. In this paper, a microcontroller-based optimization use of power-density has been carried out. Meeting above requirements, various equipment and electronic devices are employed. We have designed a microcontroller-based system via PROTEUS Virtual System Modeling to acquire efficient and effective results. The main focus of our work is to supply the power to Telecom equipment in meantime. The power is feeding on batteries and DG (Diesel Generator) set, depending on the condition of the power requirements. The changeover operations are performed by different relays, which are dully programmed via a microcontroller in Keil software. The power capacity of Telecom ((Telecommunication) equipment is ranged from 39-48 Volts DC. The rectification process is done by switch mode rectifiers instead of linear rectifiers. Because the switch-mode rectifier technology has brought fabulous improvements in power density as compared to linear rectifiers. This is done via simulation of the smart switch in PROTEUS software. The outcomes of the proposed system are costeffective in terms of fuel consumption of DG.</div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Controlling the non-linear dynamics of the quad-copter has stimulated many control engineers to investigate & design the variety ofcontrollers in order to control and stabilize the various aspects of quad copter such as the attitude, altitude, heading, xy position and even intrajectory following in the presence of disturbance. This is because of the quad-copter‚Äôs application and importance in the variety of fieldssuch as military, rescue, agriculture, surveillance, investigation, etc. Altitude control & stabilization problem of the quad-copter is the mainfocus of this research study. A dynamic and predictive controller is designed for the said problem based on Model predictive controller. Inorder to deal with the uncertainties & dynamics of the model during the flight operation and to ensure the robustness for the designed system,the sliding mode control technique is presented. Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller is also implemented for the system to make acomparative analysis with the rest of the designed controllers. Apart from controlling & stabilizing the altitude, these controllers are alsocapable for the trajectory tracking of the quad-copter. The six degree of freedom coupled model of quad-copter is taken into account and thesame is then de-coupled for quad-copter hovering. In order to confirm the asymptotically stable state of the system, stability analysis of theproposed controller design is also done. The designed system is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK and also the comparison for robust andpredictive controller is presented in order to depict the degree of potency of the proposed controller. </div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Economic growth is an important factor for the development of any country and mainly it is affected by the energy crises available. Pakistan is among the countries facing the energy threats and shortages. This paper contributes towards reduction of energy crises by moving towards renewable energy resources. The objective of the paper is to utilize the solar energy in replacement of conventional energy resources focusing the street lighting systems. Economic and environmental analysis is made for the replacement of 250W High Pressure Sodium lights with solar powered lights at khairpur Mir‚Äôs Sindh, Pakistan. For economic analysis, initial cost, energy consumption cost and maintenance cost of both lighting systems are explored while the environmental analysis is carried out by investigating the carbon emission for both of the systems. In addition to this, simple payback period and internal rate of return are also explored for economic analysis. Resultant data obtained from both types of lighting systems is compared with each other to highlight the effectiveness of solar LED lights. Presented analysis shows the attractiveness of solar powered LED lights in the street lighting systems as the government of Pakistan will be saving more than seventy million rupees in 25 years and more than 13 metric tons of carbon emissions are avoided. The results obtained from the study (economic and environment) reflects towards the implementation of such systems utilizing the naturally available resources in the countries like Pakistan. Based on the data, method and results presented such analysis could be done for different areas for different renewable energy sources available in different countries. </div>

However, parameters affecting drone data collecting flight operations must also be explored, including drone actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile. The drone flight time would depend upon the battery capacity and energy consumption profile, which comprises drone movement, data collection, and communication energies. Besides, data collection energy consumption is subjected to video quality, frame rates, and data compression. The installed battery in UAVs is of limited capacity and determining actual flight time, data collection time, and energy consumption profile based on the factors mentioned above is critical. This paper develops and examines a drone energy consumption profile and proposes a drone flight strategy in a surveillance scenario to correctly estimate the drone's actual flight time, data collection time, and the distance the drone could travel from its original location. The results of this analysis are presented as a test case for flying a drone to collect the traffic monitoring data.</div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Drones and video processing have become a vital and integrated aspect of smart city development in several applications such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. Newly, camera-equipped drones are flown, and high-resolution photos and video data are relayed via a communication link to the base station. Apart from tackling the video processing issues in applications, such as object identification and tracking, energy consumption that may present a stumbling block in completing a successful drone flight for data collecting must be highlighted and considered. Drones have a limited amount of energy storage, which must be used to power the drone's movement, hovering, data collection, and communication. This study aims at building and testing a drone energy profile that estimates the total energy consumed and a maximum flying time of a drone in a traffic monitoring scenario. Additionally, the relationship between the video processing task and the drone energy profile is explored to determine the optimal strategy for flying the drones while maintaining the video processing task's performance. The conclusion of this evaluation and investigation can be conceived of as the test-case scenario to fly a drone for surveillance and monitoring applications to attain the optimum results.</div>

            <div class="abstract-text">Vision Meets Drone: Multiple Object Tracking (VisDrone-MOT2021) challenge-the forth annual activity organized by the VisDrone team-focuses on benchmarking UAV MOT algorithms in realistic challenging environments. It is held in conjunction with ICCV 2021. VisDrone-MOT2021 contains 96 video sequences in total, including 56 sequences (‚àº24K frames) for training, 7 sequences (‚àº3K frames) for validation and 33 sequences (‚àº13K frames) for testing. Bounding-box annotations for novel object categories are provided every frame and temporally consistent instance IDs are also given. Additionally, occlusion ratio and truncation ratio are provided as extra useful annotations. The results of eight state-of-the-art MOT algorithms are reported and discussed. We hope that our VisDrone-MOT2021 challenge will facilitate future research and applications in the field of UAV vision. The website of our challenge can be found at http://www.aiskyeye.com/.</div>

                Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become dominant recently in all fields including military, commercial, and other multiapplications, such as agriculture, search and rescue, infrastructures monitoring, and surveillance, especially for safety and security purposes. On one hand, deployment of UAVs has facilitated end-users and, on the other hand, this enormous increase in the usage of UAVs has raised many concerns with regard to security, harm, threats, and privacy issues by different agencies, governments, private organizations even by people in their residencies, which has stimulated and motivated many researchers toward the designing of anti-drone systems in order to be secure from such risks. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive survey concerning the work carried out in the designing of an anti-drone system for detection, localization, and tracking using Radio Frequency (RF-) and WiFi-based techniques. In the category of drone detection, drone identification, and classification are also being explored. In more detail, this chapter will highlight the key factors of the surveyed techniques and the characteristics of such systems to deploy them, practically. Indeed, current studies provide systematic ways to understand the procedures, methods, tools, and techniques, as well as experimental setups, which have been carried out for the implementation of drone-surveillance systems. A comparison of the performance, found in the literature, of the designed systems in this field is presented and analysed. Finally, open challenges, possible future research trends, and direction are highlighted in the context of drone detection, localization, and tracking systems. The presented survey chapter is aimed at providing a guide for the research community as it could be an ignition to work further with specific direction so making these crucial systems versatile and ready to be deployed practically to meet their potential market demand.</div>
